# Periodic Table of Svelements

This is a simple project to recreate the periodic table of elements with `Svelte`. The `json` data used in the project comes from https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON and the starting template for `Svelte` with `Tailwind CSS` support can be found at https://github.com/colinbate/svelte-ts-tailwind-template.

## Getting started

Clone or download the repo, then navigate to the root directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

The directory should already have everything you need to render the periodic table of elements in your local machine. To start the local development server, navigate to the root directory and enter the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

After the process is complete, you should see a message like `Your application is ready~!`, head over to `localhost:5000` to view the app.
